        <p>okay so the first reason is prolly one of the most important like yk ever since I got with you, you've always tried your hardest to be there for me whenever I needed it, it's just that no one's ever cared much ab what I feel and stuff, except you, you made me feel like this part of me mattered Sarah, and I can never forget this, even through the most down parts of our relationship, you were still there every time I needed you and I cant thank you enough for that ‚ù§Ô∏è this is just one of the reasons i love you Sarah</p>
